         Degree Constrained Minimum Spanning Tree Test Data
The CRD and SYM data sets have been obtained from A Volgenant, the remainder
have been created by A Ernst and M Krishnamoorthy.

Format:
The CRD files contain simply co-ordinates in a 2-dimensional
euclidean space (truncate to integer). All others contain 1/2 of the symmetric
cost matrix between all pairs of points. ie these should be read with a loop
of the form:
  FOR i=1..n:
    FOR j=1..i-1:
      distance(i,j)=distance(j,i) = read_next_number;

Other files:
Data generators: the .c files contain data generators for different types of
                 data sets. Use at your own risk.
